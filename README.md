this is just a simple MD code... a kind of sandbox for methods... 
which get added based on my needs or free time... bits of code are lifted from 
my previous projects... from an earlier life.
the meat is found in Î¼MD
the name is a based on the fact first ensemble implemented usually in a MD code is
micro canonical...
the project is not opensource in spirit of a community...
